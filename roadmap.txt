Definitely implement:

1. command tree file, feeds into command dispatcher and autocomplete.



Maybe?

1. Collapsable response and prompt row 
    -like showing party member char profile can make console look messy.
2. tabs to better show option data
    -ref https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_tabs

3. command dispatcher 
    -Aliases mean letting commands have shortcuts, like "cs" for "char_select".
